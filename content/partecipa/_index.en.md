We are a group of local organisations and volunteers who have always been involved in voluntary work, solidarity and territorial development.

Today, more than ever, we believe that this momentum is useful and necessary to support our community in such a difficult and painful situation.

**We are open to the contribution and support of all the people who want to help us make this project more complete and, ultimately, more in line with the needs of citizens, especially the most fragile.**


You can join us too
