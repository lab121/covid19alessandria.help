**The Covid19 epidemic does not spare anyone, but somebody do not have the chance to protect themselves. You can help them.**

The situation in the Italian prisons is difficult.

Overcrowding and border-line conditions of the detainees in our prisons were always a problem, and today with the current pandemic reality is getting even tenser.

**Masks are missing, and the virus passes also through the bars.**

For this reason the labs of the Casa Circondariale Alessandria “Cantiello Gaeta”, of the Don Soria prison and of the Casa di Reclusione “San Michele”
decided to build indipendently their own masks. The difficulties in collecting fabric and elastic bands require your help.

Help us collecting funds to give **fabric and elastic bands** to these people, permitting also to them to pretect themselves from the virus.
