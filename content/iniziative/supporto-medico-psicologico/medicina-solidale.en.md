Medical online counseling service for those who need medical consultation and are in difficulty, economic destitution, can't pay for private structures fees,
or can't -because of the current restrictions- access to the Servizio Sanitario Nazionale (public service).

The service does NOT deal with the Covid-19 emergency (e.g. access modality to swabs and diagnostics), but can anyway provide orientation and general
information connected with it (e.g. directions about the use of the pulse oximeter).

Technical modalities of the service:
+ First access: via e-mail to medisolidale@gmail.com or by phone (+39)351/6955152

The initiative was born in Milan from an idea of Dr. Alessandro Lanzani, specialist in orthopedics and sports medicine.
