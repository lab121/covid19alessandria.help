Soleterre gained a direct experience in the Covid-19 emergency thanks to a team of 14 psychologists, who granted psychological support to medical staff,
patients and relatives at the Policlinico San Matteo of Pavia.

NIn the second phase of the Covid emergency Soleterre expanded its action to the national territory:
+	**for affected and hospitalized people**
+	**for people who lost a relative**
+	**for nursing health staff**
+	**for people with particular psycho-social weakness, worsened by the Covid emergency**

For these people **Soleterre set up a national fund for psychological support to Covid-19.**
