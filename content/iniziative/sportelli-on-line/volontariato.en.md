The CSVAA (Centro Servizi per il Volontariato Asti Alessandria) is helping the Third Sector Entities by providing free services of technical, educational and informational support. The aim is promoting solidarity and volunteering, in indipendent modality as well as together with other social parties.  
It is then also an information and orientation desk for those who want to know and approach the world of volunteering: to start a new ETS (third sector entity) or to volunteer by an already active association.  
The CSVAA helps furthermore by orienting  and informing about the Reform Bill of the Third Sector (L.117/2017) and the direct implications for the ETS.  
Due to the actual health emergency, the service center provides to the volunteering world also all the information concerning the legal provisions about the Covid19 pandemic (Dining Decree, containment measures, etc.).  
The access to the CSVAA support is possible thanks to the operators available on this portal on Thursdays from 3pm to 4pm.
