Home delivery and take-away not only for food and beverages, but also for books of the Biblioteca Civica in Alessandria, from Tuesday, December 1st.  
In spite of the library closures due to last restrictions against Covid-19 pandemic, books turn to be available for the citizenship again.  
From Mondays to Fridays, from 9 to 13, it is possible to pick up at the reception of the Biblioteca Civica the books booked on the phone or via e-mail.  
Home delivery will be moreover possible for readers. This is free and is effectuated twice a week for the registered inhabitants of Alessandria.  
Deliveries occur thanks to the voluteers of the Servizio Civile Universale, active in the "Libri in citt√†" project of the Biblioteca Civica "Francesca Calvo".  
The successful sinergy between libriarians and volunteers extend the availabilty not only to novels, essays, biographies and to the last literary news of our catalogue, but also to volumes of other associated libraries.  
The initative arises from the statement that in such a difficult historical moment books and reading are a primary necessity. They nourish critical thinking and are, at the meantime, a pleasant diversion instrument at home. For information: Biblioteca Civica "Francesca Calvo", Tel. (+39)0131515917 from Tuesdays to Fridays from 9,00 to 13,00
