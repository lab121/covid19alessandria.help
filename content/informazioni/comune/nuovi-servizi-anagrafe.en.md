With the new online services of the demographic department of the municipality of Alessandria (fully active from Monday, December 14th 2020) the citizenship can directly request and obtain anagraphic certificates, without going to the town hall.
Requesting anagraphic certificates and other anagraphic paperwork is feasible now through the web site of the municipality of Alessandria (https://servizionline.comune.alessandria.it - clicking on "Servizi anagrafici").
Every citizen can make requests from home: applications reach the system and after a check they get processed, generating a PDF certificate,which is officially signed by the anagraphic department official.
The certificate can be directly downloaded from the web site, and can be sent to the e-mail address, which was communicated at the registration on the portal.
