The tender to create a net of "assisted hotels" started. They should offer social health support to people over 65, who are positive to Covid-19 but asymptomatic, and hotel rooms for patients who have been released from the hospitals but still positive, who do not necessitate sanitary support but can't stay at home. The aim is vacating beds.
