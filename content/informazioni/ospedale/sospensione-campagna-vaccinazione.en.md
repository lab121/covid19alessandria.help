ASL AL communicates that the anti-flu vaccine campaign at the local labs is suspended.  
The suspension facilitates the availability of the vaccine doses stocked at the ASL AL warehouses for the general practionioners who will be able to use them for the weakest patients.  
This measure is the consequence of the missing delivery of about 400.000 vaccine doses from the supplier of the Regione Piemonte.  
The already booked vaccines will be granted.  
The phone numbers aimed to book vaccines by the useres are subsequently suspended.  
The vaccine campaign at the local sites is an extraordinary measure which ASL AL activated in the month of October in order to support the general practitioners, responding the increasing anti-flu vaccine demand.  
This demand was generated in the population in the citizenship due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  
The campaign was giving good results, because on November 25th in the province of Alessandia 65.999 people were vaccinated: about 30% more than in the same date last year.  
According to the Assessor Icardi's figures, at regional level 900.000 vaccine doses were delivered.  
On November 20th more than 613.000 people were vaccinated in Piedmont; this figure corresponds approximately to all vaccinated people in 2019 (700.000).  
Pediatric vaccine campaigns go on regularly, as well as the ones for TBC, Pneumococcus, Hepatitis A and B,  and yellow fever.
