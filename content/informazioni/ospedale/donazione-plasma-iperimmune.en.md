Those who lived a symptomatic form of Covid-19, once recovered, can help people who are affected today.  
How? Donating hyperimmune plasma.  
The therapy takes advantage of the antibodies in the plasma of those who recovered from the virus.
Today it is used in many hospitals as an emergency method, until an official cure will be available.

**The transfusion center of Ospedale Civico di Alessandria recruits hyperimmune plasma donators.**

For booking the visit it is necessary to call **(+39)0131206417** from 8am to 1pm, from Mondays to Saturdays.
