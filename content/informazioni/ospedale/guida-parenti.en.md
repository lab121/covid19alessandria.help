**COVID DEPARTMENTS**

##### Family visits
Family visits are not allowed, but other contact modalities are possible with your relatives, for example through videocalls if possible

##### Linen change
+ In the night the personnel makes a list of the patients who need clean linen, reporting specifically the missing pieces of clothing
+ In the following morning the list is communicated to the relatives contacted by the personnel
+ At the entrance of the hospital the relative has to fill in the certification given by the reception
+ At the entrance of the department the relative gives the operator the clean linen, but he's not allowed to enter
+ The personnel picks up the clean linen and gives back the dirty one, as per procedure, in two bags (one is water-soluble)

The linen given to the relatives from the Covid departments is envelopped in bags: the clean external one and the dirty internal water-soluble one, which contains linen for the patient; this is dirty only in the most external side, at direct contact with the clothes.  
The delivery and the transport happen then in total safety. 
At home it is necessary only to open the external bag. The internal one, containing the patient's linen, is hydrosoluble and it is going to melt at water and detergent contact: the dirty linen remains inside and can be safely put into the washing machine. We advise to use also disinfectant products. In this way relatives never enter in direct contact with the covid-patient's linen.

We remind to always wash your hands at the end of the procedure.
