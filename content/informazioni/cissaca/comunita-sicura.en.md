It is a Cissaca initiative, financed by the Sanpaolo company with the tender Intrecci 2018, experienced for the first time at the Cristo district of Alessandria. Its aim is promoting the aged people's welfare at home.  
The partnership among Cissaca, ASL Alessandria and Il Gabbiano cooperative is going to be enhanced by the net of associations already operating in the district.  
Its origins can be found in the cooperation of a group of representatives of the institutions, of the associations, of the world of commerce and of the third sector.  
It is based on the idea of partecipation to the community as a whole, building a net of effective help, not only thank to the action of the social health services, but also to the valorisation of the sympathetic relationships, which feature the district life.
