Inspired by the national platform Covid19Italia.help, Covid19Alessandria.help is a non-profit project promoted by some local realities to share useful information during the emergency and facilitate the activation of people and organizations in the city of Alessandria.

We do this by aggregating and verifying information of a different nature in order **to bring together those who offer goods and services and those who need them**.

In the website, alongside service communications, **we have also included institutional information, with the aim of offering an exhaustive picture of everything possible**, it is necessary to know at this (super) complicated time. 

We also included ad-hoc modules to allow citizens to report and integrate other services and activities and **to collect the adhesions of those who would like to contribute with their time and skills to the development of this project**.

We do not intend to replace institutional channels and sources, but to integrate with them to ensure better accessibility to all citizens.

The platform is strictly in progress, information is verified and updated by volunteers in real time, we apologize in advance if some indications will not be 100% complete.

Covid19Alessandria.help was awarded by the Scientific Committee of Corriere Buone Notizie, the supplement dedicated to the Third Sector of the Milanese newspaper, as the most significant national network experience that emerged during the pandemic:

"A network experience born from the bottom up that can represent a prototype of \"digital common good\". This initiative proves that it is possible to respond to the needs of the health, economic and social emergency by pooling expertise and potential. Covid19Alessandria.help has the necessary flexibility to adapt to renewed territorial contexts and needs by encouraging shared governance between the Local Authority and the Third Sector to promote a more efficient use of resources and greater synergy between the public, the private social sector and the local community".
